# Debian Package Installer
Supports any distro based on Debian (Ubuntu, ZorinOS, etc).

## About
This is a simple package installer created for mainly my own use when I setup a new Debian install. It helps me out quite a bit with not having to remember all the programs I need to install.

I will add more commonly needed packages as I require them for workflow. 

You can install everything in the package, or select the number for the specific package you wish to install.

## Packages Installed
